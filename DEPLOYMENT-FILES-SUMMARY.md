## 💡 Tips

1. **Test Locally First**: Your app is currently running locally - test everything before deploying

2. **Free Tier is Enough**: All services offer free tiers suitable for testing and small projects

3. **Deployment Time**: Allow 30-45 minutes for first deployment

4. **Auto-Deploy**: Once set up, pushing to GitHub automatically deploys to both services

5. **Environment Variables**: Double-check all env vars - most issues come from missing/incorrect values
